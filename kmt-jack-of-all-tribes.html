Главный герой игры Джек, в результате необъяснимых событий, попадает в воронку времени и оказывается заброшенным в далекое прошлое, в доисторическую эпоху нашей планеты. Hooo boy. Let's break each character down one-by-one shall we? Spike : This is probably the least offensive of the choices. You can argue Spike is Japanese (I always thought he was Jewish but that's because of me growing up with the dub), so if they just get a curly 'fro on this dude then he'd make a decent Spike. Jet : Probably the most offensive of the picks imho. This dude looks NOTHING like Jack! AT ALL!!

They enter town down the main street and there's a couple people here and there. Some shop owners standing out front of their place enjoying the weather etc. The general store owner comes running #Farm That I Should - Nelveska Temple and Desert Despair (Substitute SIFT Edition) u/testmonkeyalpha's out for the week enjoying his/her vacation, and SIFT request comments have been popping up like bunnies in the DHT.

Okay, so I'm going to preface this: I personally believe we are not chaotic evil for saying this. However, I am also the type of person who can feel that a bias sits so firmly within a person that it could skew their perception without their notice, even if they attempt to be unbiased. I will do my best to pose this in such a way that it is without bias. However, this is ultimately my perspective on the matter, so take it as you will. It's also a year's worth of crap. I apologize for this being. Hello fellow wastelanders! Today pleasant valley would like to send an emissary to the other factions to share culture and history. Please don't shoot the messenger. Raiders have a storied history in fallout, literally being one of the first groups one encounters from the outset of fallout 1. The history of these raiders is well documented and fairly in depth. From vault 15 in California 4 groups set out, 3 of which were hostile and didn't agree with the others for varying reasons. Please format your submissions going forward like below. It allows me to port this list into a website and automatically create the weekly playlist so I don't need to manually add every song 1 by 1. It would be a big help. Thanks. If it is more than 1 artist, please use a comma not &. If there is a feature, please add them as well with a comma in the artist section. If it is a remix, remix pack, or EP please enter that at the end with parenthesis. _______ Example: Alok, Felix Jaehn ## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter board game projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ending in the next 7 days (starting Mar 18) and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

Don't know if its true. ## RDR2 Cut Content according to a developer 📷 Hi, I worked at Rockstar on RDR2 for a little over 6 years and felt like talking about some of the stuff that was removed from the game for one reason or another. This is going to be a pretty long list and most of it is from memory and will spoil a lot of the story in the final product. You've been warned. Also some of this stuff may contradict other. 
What are humans like in your universe? How have they adapted to the time frame/environment around them? I want to know if you guys have differentiated them from the bog-standard 'Jack of All Trades' or if they have a specific niche that they fill themselves. Sort of also want to compare it to my Humans The Humans in my book are essentially Great Britain at its height of colonial power but is aesthetically the Confederate States of America.

Hello fellow ravers, earilier this week i asked to see if there was intrest in having a weekly spotify release overview. The amount of upvotes convinced me to go for it. So please find below the first run of the app. I want to state up front that i have some issues with "luna" and "the prophet" there are too many hits which don't match what i want to get back, but that will be fixed in a later release. The current scope of artists is taken from: https://www.hards. First off, I really love what Invisibilia does and their overall goal of trying to help people have empathy for people that don't usually receive empathy. Second, I would also like to applaud Leena for challenging that notion because her world view does not match up with that of Hanna, at least in this particular instance. And ultimately, in no way do I condone any of Jack's behavior or what he did in this episode. But I don't really think Hanna was condoning it either or attempting the listener. The best human restaurant in Poseidon City is in the low-rent part of a red light district right between two whore houses. This is because the rest of the galaxy considers human food repulsive. It's a place called "Eat" and it's run by a disreputable pervert called rEEE'oOoKK. Pronounce that name like someone killing a bagpipe. "Human Joe Smith! You come to eat?" "Be in the wrong place if I didn’t." I answered settling myself into a dark booth in the back corner. "Good and very good!. Told this story a long while ago on a different sub, but just found this one so thought I'd clean it up a bit and retell it. Mobile so I apologize for poor formatting and all that. Was in my second year of college, founded a tabletop gaming club with some friends the year prior. We get a good few members which means all the officers, self included, are running games so new players can get a taste of RPGing. This however means none of us really get to play, so our faculty advisor offers Yup! You heard me! I said it! I strongly believe that there is NOTHING inherently sexual about genitals and most, though certainly not all, of sex and sexuality is bad/dirty/stupid/overrated and other negative adjectives! I'm apparently some insane and prudish nut! Even though prudes don't usually defend genitals/breasts/buttocks/nudity. But apparently, I'm one of them. And yes I am a bit of hypocrite for ranting, particularly about sex and sexuality, but I'm just going to speak </p>
