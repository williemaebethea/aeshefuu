After the end times what happend to the skaven? I know lizards went to space. And also when i look at games workshop website you are able to buy lizards for the Table top game are the lizards models from fantasy warhammer or are they for age of sigmar? Also are the skaven faction in age of sigmar? Or were they replace by something. I've seen that there are like a dozen novels and a lot of novellas/quick reads/small stories, five Legends of the Age of Sigmar books etc. But can I just jump into the whole world with The Gates of Azyr and start reading up the others Hello all, so as the title says I want to get into age of sigmar, I think the minis are super cool and the battles seem sweet. And I’ve been wanting a new hobby. I first kinda got exposed AOS/warhammer from the total war computer games and I just kinda looked at what it was based off of. The biggest hurtles for me to getting into the hobby is I don’t have a lot of money, I’m going away to college soon so all my funds are going towards that, and I don’t have any experience painting or assembling. Renegades has everything NoS and is like new. It is missing a small cardboard art insert but everything else is good. Includes dice, data cards, data sheets, and Knight Range finder. Asking 0. Open to offers. The Green Knight, Carrying case, and Codex are no longer available. https://imgur.com/a/zF68WRT?s=sms (https://imgur.com/a/zF68WRT?s=sms) Iron Jaws includes everything pictured. There is a new on sprue Weird boy as well, bringing the total up to 2. Asking 0. Hello! I've been posting monster conversions that I did from Age of Sigmar over on its subreddit (r/ageofsigmar) and decided to share them here. I'll probably make a new post when I complete another one. Grand Alliance Death (Yes, all of it): https://critterdb.com/#/publishedbestiary/view/5bdf61d657cc0d3872e01f38 (https://critterdb.com/#/publishedbestiary/view/5bdf61d657cc0d3872e01f38) Ironjawz: https://critterdb.com/#/publishedbestiary/view/5bfc690957cc0d3872e064ad (https://critterdb.com/#/. I'm new to the total war games (only play Warhammer I amp II) but I've seen a lot of similarities between AoS and Warhammer. The units look the same and some of the lore is kind of similar. Are they connected in any way? Or 2 completely different entities? I've tried finding information about it but never found. </p>
