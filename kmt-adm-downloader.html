Anyway to my predicament, the latest update made the app perfect, it allowed the adm downloader app to default download 1080p or 720p whichever was the highest available. However just today, I tried to download on 9anime and it's back to previously not allowing me to change the quality because if I try to click another resolution it brings me to a blank white ad page that blocks me from changing to whatever quality. Do you have any idea what might be causing this or should.

But can you also make the download a multi-thread? Just to speed up the download speed. Thank. 
ADM downloads and uses specific types of media content. The files are accessed via the standard means of working with online storage or library resources. I have been trying to download a movie since two days and it is not working. The download reaches about halfway through and then says download unsuccessful and displays one of these two messages everytime I have tried to download the movie 3 times : "An error in receiving or processing the data occured at HTTP level" or "An error has occured and can't resume the download". How can I fix this. I need it really urgently. Thanks in advance. Hi guys this is a great app no doubt but over half of my downloads are coming back unsuccessful yet still chewing up my data is there a reason. Whenever I download any movie it goes upto 15% and then says it unsuccessful, this happens in every case. What to do, please Earlier i was able to download all movies and tv shows but for the past week i am getting error it says HTTP error : Code-429. And the download is shown as unsuccessful. I am using the latest version I've a premium account in a website that allows downloading their videos, and I can directly (IDM or built-in browser downloader) download their videos, no problem. But I can't remotely upload them to Uploaded.net (https://Uploaded.net) using its Remote upload feature. I've checked and can confirm that the content is not IP-restricted. I was able to stream and download a video, that I'd started downloading with my PC, in my smartphone (+VPN). But ADM gave me an ssl certificate error, really. Soo I've been downloading torrents at public wifi such as library's and banks I noticed there speedtests.net tests suck without a vpn and are alot faster with a vpn, so as usual Ive been downloading with express VPN on my android and the download speed for torrents is only around 400-650kbps and drops to under 100kbps when using idm, and utorrent, even downloading shows thru cyberflix TV? Apollo TV apps, I've even tried uploading the torrent to seedr.cc(online Torrent client 
Just found cessfull and wondering what people think, I think its a cheap monthly seedbox and seems to download from public trackers fairly rapid. I did run into a problem of getting a torrent from the site onto my huawei tablet, i had to re-download it from cessfull to the sd card using adm manager. As you can probably tell im not a major downloader, just looking to make things more efficient for myself. I use idm+ (very similar to adm app) for downloading video from animedlr as the inbuilt downloader of animedlr is much slower than them(p.s- i tested many times and in high speed wi-fi too). Now if I want to batch download many episodes the only option I'm left with is to use the default downloader(which is about 2-3 times slower than external downloaders), so then the process takes huge time and also the resume option is not very good in that either. Could you please improve the downloader. I select the play with option to attempt to download and ADM Pro doesn't show up, is there any way to recognize it? Or would it be possible the same way we choose to play with external player could we have a download with external downloader option. Im used to downloading my shows trough terrarium.But today when I tried to do so it doesn't show any of my external download managing apps.I can't download with the android internal downloader so i usually use Es File Explorer or ADM (the recommended one for ttv) but nothing shows up.I tried it with multiple shows and the same thing happens.Cleared cache and rebooted the app as well, but still How can i change the default downloader from samsung internet to ADM? I kept resetting the default option on samsung internet but it didnt. So I decide to make list of my favorite Android apps and games Note: Numbers are not rank but just index number (List is unranked) Please suggest in comments what else apps and game I may like Apps: 1) Nova Launcher (Home Screen) : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher 2) Dropbox (Cloud Storage): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android 3) Gboard (Keyboard): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.a. First of all I'd like to say I love this app and I've recommended to it to the whole squad. One of which wants to donate btw. Anyway, is it possible to somehow get the app to use the native Android downloader to download episodes? ADM doesn't work well for me and a few others I really love your app and would like to know it is possible to use external downloaders like ADM to download? If not can it be added in a future update. 
Currently I use MX Player as a player and ADM as a downloader. When I activate download mode, it immediately crashes when the source shows up. I tried resetting the browser settings and the default quality settings but that doesn't work. Please. Hey! First of all, thank you very much to everyone responsible for this app and subreddit, you guys are amazing! Well, my internet connection isn't very good, so it's almost impossible to watch things in HD smoothly, so I usually download everything I watch. Unfortunately, I've been having issues with the built-in downloader and, following instructions from the FAQ, started using ADM. ADM works great and downloading is way easier now, the only problem is that I have no idea how to download. </p>
